===================================================================

SofaUnZip is a  tool to extract  ZIP files on  MSX-DOS 2, based  on
Grauw's Gunzip tool (https://bitbucket.org/grauw/gunzip).

It features:

  * DEFLATE and STORE methods support.
  * Directories suppport.
  * Long file names support.
  * File time and date support.
  * Fast extraction speed.
  * CRC32 check.
  * Output concatenation to a single file (useful for disk images).

===================================================================
                           Requirements
===================================================================

Any MSX computer with MSX-DOS 2.


===================================================================
                             Usage
===================================================================

Usage: suz <command> <archive> [<files>...] [<switches>...]

<command>:
  e  Extract <files> from <archive>
  l  List <files> in <archive>
  t  Test <files> in <archive>
  x  Extract <files> from <archive> with path

<switches>:
  /b<read_buffer_size>
      Specify read buffer size in bytes (default is 2048)
  /c<file>
      Concatenate output(s) to <file>
  /f  Fast mode (no CRC check)
  /o  Overwrite existing files
  /q  Quiet mode
  /s  Short list (file names only)


===================================================================
                               Notes
===================================================================

Standard wildcards are allowed in <files> parameters.

Spaces are not allowed in the <files> parameters, try to use "?" or
"*" wildcards instead.

Long file names in  archive are extracted to  MSX-DOS 2 using a  "~
indexed" naming convention.

ZIP files containing end of file comments are not supported (you'll
get a "bad signature" error).

If you run out of memory during the extraction process, try to  use
the /f option.

/f option does not check for CRC, use it at your own risk.

/c option can be  used to create a  contatenated disk image from  a
ZIP file  containing individual  images.
For example: suz e disks.zip aleste?2*disk?* /caleste2.dsk
